                This classic Hollywood movie features a very important scene at the top of the Empire State Building.

                his chest atop the Empire State Building and swiping at the biplanes that have come to take him down. 
                King Kong's tragic end at the top of the tower holds up remarkably well almost eight decades later.</p></td>
