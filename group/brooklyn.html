It's at Sal's, where tempers flare and eventually explode on one of the hottest days of the year, ending in a torched pizzeria and tragic violence.</p></td>

Falling in love, Cher strolls the Promenade in a daze. Her character lives among the Fruit Streets-Cranberry, to be specific. And the movie makes its way down Court Street, to where the real Italian groceries can be found.</p></td>
